[[Create-Storage-Class]]
=== Create storage class in ROSA cluster
Now, let’s create the storage class.

[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f storage-class-csi-nas.yaml
----

Verify the status of the trident-csi storage class creation.

[source,shell]
----
oc get sc
----

This completes installation of Trident CSI driver and its connectivity to FSx for ONTAP file system. Now we’ll deploy a sample MySQL stateful application on ROSA using file volumes in FSx for ONTAP.

NOTE: If you want to verify applications can create PV using trident operator, create PVC using the `pvc-trident.yaml` file provided in `fsx` folder.
