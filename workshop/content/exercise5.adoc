[[Scaling-StatefulSet-Pods]]
=== Scaling StatefulSet pods
You can easily scale the MySQL StatefulSet application using the following command.

[source,shell]
----
oc scale statefulsets mysql-set --replicas=4 -n mysql
----

Check the number of pods running using this command

[source,shell]
----
oc get pods -n mysql
----

This demonstrates the horizontal scaling of Statefulset pods.
