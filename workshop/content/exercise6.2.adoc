== Delete the database "erp"

To delete the database "erp" after creating a snapshot (backup) in 6.1, follow these steps:

1. Log into the container console using a new terminal. Please note that this is not the same as the one used in 6.1.

[source,bash]
----
oc exec --stdin --tty mysql-client -n mysql -- sh
mysql -u root -p -h mysql-set-0.mysql.mysql.svc.cluster.local
----

2. You will be prompted to enter the MySQL root password. After entering the password, you'll get into the MySQL command-line interface.

3. Delete the "erp" database.

[source,sql]
----
MySQL [(none)]> DROP DATABASE erp;
----

4. After executing the DROP command, the database "erp" will be deleted, and you should see a message like:

[source]
----
Query OK, 1 row affected
----

Remember, before deleting any database, ensure that you have a proper backup of the data and are certain that you want to proceed with the deletion.
