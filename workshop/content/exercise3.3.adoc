[[Configure-Trident-Backend]]
=== Configure Trident CSI backend to FSx for ONTAP
The Trident backend configuration tells the Trident how to communicate with the storage system (in this case, FSx for ONTAP). We’ll use the ontap-nas driver to provision storage volumes.

To get started, move into the `fsx` directory of your cloned git repository. Open the file `backend-ontap-nas.yaml`. Replace the `managementLIF` and `dataLIF` in that file with the Management DNS name and NFS DNS name of Amazon FSx Storage Virtual Machine and `svm` with SVM name as per the following screenshot.

NOTE: `ManagementLIF` and `DataLIF` can be found via the Amazon FSx Console under “Storage virtual machines” as shown in the following screenshot:

Now let’s execute the following commands in the terminal to configure the Trident backend in our ROSA cluster.

[source,shell]
----
cd fsx 
oc apply -f backend-ontap-nas.yaml
----

Verify the backend configuration.

[source,shell]
----
oc get tbc -n trident
----

After successful configuration of the trident backend, we will create a storage class that will use the backend we created above
