== Restore the snapshot `backup_point_01` from SVM

To restore the volume with the snapshot `backup_point_01` that you created earlier, follow these steps:

1. Go back to the ONTAP CLI.

2. Use the `snap restore` command with the appropriate arguments to perform the restore.

[source,bash]
----
SVM1::> snap restore -volume trident_pvc_81731fc1_7e84_4f4f_9525_fb16125aeba0 -snapshot backup_point_01
----

Make sure to replace `trident_pvc_81731fc1_7e84_4f4f_9525_fb16125aeba0` with the actual volume name you want to restore.

This command will restore the volume with the contents from the `backup_point_01` snapshot.

Remember to verify the restoration to ensure that the volume is restored successfully.
